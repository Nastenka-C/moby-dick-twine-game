# Moby Dick Twine Game

This is the final project for my interdisciplinary course at Baruch College. Throughout the semester we studied the development of different ideas of human-animal relations in the Atlantic world from the fifteenth to nineteenth centuries. Our main source of information was "The Tame and the Wild: People and Animals after 1492" By Marcy Norton. To wrap up the semester, we read "Moby Dick" by Herman Melville which follows the story of Captain Ahab, a whaler, who is viciously tracking the whale, Moby Dick, who previously bit off his leg. Spoiler Alert: The hunt leads to everyones death except for the storyteller Ishmael.

# About the Game
The game embodies a "what if" conversation between two of the main characters Ishmael and Queequeg following Captain Ahab's famous speech. They converse about the morality and necessity of Ahab's vengance. The player's choices will lead to either the death or survival of their character.
